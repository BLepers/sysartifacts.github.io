## Overview

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the document itself.
Based on the success of artifact evaluation from SOSP’21 and SOSP’19, SOSP’23 will run an **optional** artifact evaluation process. All papers accepted at SOSP’23 are encouraged to participate in the artifact evaluation process.

The artifact evaluation process will consider the availability and functionality of artifacts associated with their corresponding papers, along with the reproducibility of the paper’s key results and claims with these artifacts. Artifact evaluation is single blind. Artifacts will be held in confidence by the evaluation committee. While the committee strongly encourages the authors of SOSP papers to make their artifacts publicly available, the artifact evaluation process is open to artifacts that are not.

All accepted SOSP papers are encouraged to participate in artifact evaluation. 
See [Submitting an Artifact](#submitting-an-artifact) for details on the submission process.

You can contact the [AEC chairs](organizers) for any questions.

## Important Dates

*All AEC deadlines are at 6 PM EDT*

- Notification for paper authors: *Sunday, July 16, 2023*
- Artifact intent registration deadline: *Friday, July 21, 2023*
- Artifact submission deadline: *Friday, July 28, 2023*

*Note:* For an artifact to be considered, at least one contact author for the submission must be reachable via email and respond to questions in a timely manner during the kick-the-tires period.

## Benefits and Goals

The dissemination of artifacts benefits our science and engineering as a whole. Their availability encourages replicability and reproducibility and enables authors to build on top of each others’ work. It can also help more unambiguously resolve questions about cases not considered by the original authors. It also confers direct and indirect benefits to the authors themselves.

The goal of artifact evaluation is to incentivize authors to invest in their broader scientific community by producing artifacts that illustrate their claims, enable others to validate those claims, and accelerate future scientific progress by providing a platform for others to start from. A paper with artifacts that have passed the artifact evaluation process is recognized in two ways: first by badges that appear on the paper’s first page, and second by an appendix that details the artifacts.

Eventually, the assessment of a paper’s accompanying artifacts may guide the decision-making about papers: that is, the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) would inform and advise the Program Committee (PC). This year, artifact evaluation will begin only after paper acceptance decisions have already been made. Artifact evaluation is optional, although we hope all papers will participate.

## Criteria

Each paper sets up certain expectations and claims of its artifacts based on its content. The AEC will read the paper and then judge whether the artifacts match those criteria. Thus, the AEC’s decision will be that the artifacts do or do not "conform to the expectations set by the paper." Ultimately, the AEC expects that high-quality artifacts will be:

- consistent with the paper
- as complete as possible
- documented well
- easy to reuse, facilitating further research

## Process

Authors will be invited to submit their artifacts after their papers have been accepted for publication at SOSP. Because the time between paper acceptance and artifact submission is short, the AEC chairs encourage authors to start preparing their artifacts for evaluation while their papers are still under consideration by the SOSP Program Committee. See the [guidelines for packaging artifacts later in this document](#packaging-artifacts).

At artifact-submission time, a submitter will choose the criteria by which their artifacts will be evaluated. The criteria correspond to three separate badges that can be awarded to a paper, as defined by the [ACM Artifact Review and Badging policy v1.1](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current). An artifact can meet the criteria of one, two, or all three of the following badges:

- *Artifacts Available* - Author-created artifacts relevant to this paper have been placed on a publically accessible archival repository. A DOI or link to this repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.
- *Artifacts Evaluated - Functional* - The artifacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.
- *Results Reproduced* - The main results of the paper have been obtained in a subsequent study by a person or team other than the authors, using, in part, artifacts provided by the author.

After the artifact submission deadline, members of the AEC will download each artifact package, read the accepted paper, install the artifacts (where relevant), and finally evaluate the artifacts. AEC members may communicate with artifact authors, through HotCRP to maintain the evaluators’ anonymity, to resolve minor issues and ask clarifying questions. Authors must respond to messages from the AEC in a timely manner for their artifacts to be effectively considered.

The AEC will complete its evaluation and notify authors of the outcomes. Authors can use the time between notification and the camera-ready deadline to incorporate feedback and artifact details into the camera-ready versions of their papers. This is intended to allow authors to include the feedback from the AEC, at their option.

## Artifact Details

TBD

## Review and Anonymity

Artifact evaluation is “single blind.” The identities of artifact authors will be known to members of the AEC, but authors will not know which members of the AEC have reviewed their artifacts.

To maintain the anonymity of artifact evaluators, the authors of artifacts should not embed any analytics or other tracking in the websites for their artifacts for the duration of the artifact-evaluation period. If you cannot control this, do not access this data. This is important to maintain the confidentiality of the evaluators. In cases where tracing is unavoidable, authors should notify the AEC chairs in advance so that AEC members can take adequate safeguards.
