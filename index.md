## Artifact Evaluation at SOSP 2019 

SOSP [2019](https://sosp19.rcs.uwaterloo.ca) will be organizing an artifact evaluation process with a goal of validating the results of the accepted papers as well as recognizing the authors who have put in the effort to release usable software systems. Stay tuned for more details!

We are currently in the process of forming the artifact evaluation committee (AEC). [Prof. Baris Kasikci](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/) and Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) have agreed to chair the inagural AEC. If you are an early career researcher, postdoc, or senior graduate student interested in joining this effort, please fill out the following [form](https://forms.gle/TjaXBGVmW87nD3sQ9). All submissions received before 8/1/2019 midnight EST would be considered.

For any questions, reach out to the organizing chair, [Supreeth Shastri](shastri@utexas.edu).
