Reposted call for artifacts from [USENIX OSDI
Website](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/call-for-artifacts).

## Overview

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the document itself, yet many of our conferences offer no formal means to submit and evaluate anything but the paper itself. To address this shortcoming, this year OSDI will run an optional artifact evaluation process for the first time.

Submitting an Artifact
Full details on artifact evaluation including the timeline and process will be posted here in advance of the OSDI submission deadline. Artifact evaluation will not begin until after paper acceptance notifications, but authors should consider preparing their artifacts in advance as part of the paper authoring process.

The artifact evaluation process will consider the functionality of artifacts associated with their corresponding papers along with the replicability of the paper's key results with these artifacts. Artifact review will be single-blind, and artifacts will be held in confidence by the review committee, so artifacts that may not eventually become available after camera-ready are eligible to participate.

Questions about the process can be directed to osdi20aec@usenix.org.

## Artifact Committee Self-Nominations

We will be looking for volunteers to self-nominate to participate in artifact evaluation. Early-career researchers and graduate students are especially encouraged to participate. A self-nomination form will be posted here in the coming weeks.
