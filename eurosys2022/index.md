A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond
the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw
survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on.
In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the
document itself. Based on the success of the AEC from previous SOSP, OSDI, and
EuroSys will continue to run an optional artifact evaluation process.
