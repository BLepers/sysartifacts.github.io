<h2>Important Details</h2>
<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left:0; line-height: 1.5em;">
<li><b>Submission site:</b> <a href="https://sosp19ae.hotcrp.com/">https://sosp19ae.hotcrp.com/</a></li>
<li><b>Deadlines:</b> August 1, 2019 AoE (to register intent)
			<br>August 7, 2019 AoE (to submit artifacts towards the Artifact Available Badge)
			<br>August 16, 2019 AoE (to submit artifacts towards Artifact Functional/Results Replicated Badges)</li>
<li><b>Notification: </b> August 28, 2019</li>
<li><b>Submission type:</b> Single blind (i.e., assigned AEC members will know the authors of the artifact)</li>
<li><b>Awards:</b> Based on the AEC reviews, one or more artifacts will receive <em>Distinguished Artifact award</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for Authors</h2>
<p>Authors should strive to package their artifacts in a way that makes it easy for the AEC members to use and evaluate them. For most artifacts, this translates to packaging all the required software within a bootable VM or as a Docker image. However, given the breadth of systems covered at SOSP, we will let the authors use their judegement.</p>

<p><b>1. Determine target badge type:</b> The first step is to determine the type of badge the authors intend to seek for their artifact. While <em>Artifact Available</em> is the easiest achieve, we encourage the authors to pursue <em>Artifact Functional</em> or <em>Results evaluated</em> badges as these are likely to increase the imapct of the work. Then, register on HotCRP to declare your intent to participate in the AEC process.</p>

<p><b>2. Package and submit:</b> Next, create a package that contains the following items (i) fully self-contained artifact, (ii) a <em>readme file</em> that describes the contents of the artifact, and setup instructions, (iii) for authors targeting <em>Artifact Functional</em> and <em>Results evaluated</em>, an <em>experiments file</em> that outlines how to run and reproduce the key results of the paper. Upload this package into HotCRP using a compressed archive format like tar-zip. Please prepare the instructions such that a competent systems person can understand and follow them.</p>

<p><b>3. Communicate and engage with AEC:</b> We expect each artifact to be evaluated by 2 AEC members. While AEC members have strong expertise in systems, the time available for evaluation is limited. Thus, it is important for the authors to interact (anonymously via HotCRP) with their assigned AEC members to provide any clarifications or logistical support towards completing the process in a timely manner.</p>
